TODOs / thoughts:

- Might switch embeddings to larger model if needed.
- Maybe add timestamped logging later.
- Retrieval sometimes returns slightly irrelevant chunk → tweak k value?
- Could package as CLI tool but not needed for now.

Test prompts:
- "What does Ambedkar say is the real obstacle?"
- "Does the speech talk about caste?"
